# Step 1: Set Up Django Project
1/Install Django:
```
pip install django
```
2/Create Django Project:
```
django-admin startproject your_project_name
```
3/Navigate to Project Directory:
```    
cd your_project_name
```
4/Create Django Apps:
```
python manage.py startapp resume
python manage.py startapp task
```
# Step 2: Configure Django Apps
-   Add the created apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
# other apps...
'resume',
'task',
]
```
# Step 3: Create Models and Migrate
1/Define Models:
-   In the `models.py` file of each app (`resume` and `task`), define your models.
2/Migrate Database
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
# Step 4: Create Django Views and Templates
1/Create Views:
-   Define views for each app in their respective `views.py` files.
2/Create Templates:
-   Create HTML templates in each app's `templates` directory.
# Step 5: Set Up React App
1/Install Node.js and npm:
-   Install Node.js and npm from  [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en "Click Here").
2/Create React App:
```
npx create-react-app react_app
```
3/Navigate to React App Directory:
```
cd react_app
```
# Step 6: Connect React App with Django
1/Install Django-CORS-Headers:
-   Install the CORS headers package for Django.
```
pip install django-cors-headers
```
2/Configure Django Settings:
-   Add `corsheaders` to INSTALLED_APPS and `corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE` in `settings.py`.
-   Set `corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware` at the top of the `MIDDLEWARE` list.
3/Configure CORS Settings:
-   Add the following to `settings.py`:
```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
"http://localhost:3000",  # or your React app's URL
]
```
# Step 7: Connect React Components
1/Update React App:
-   Update React components in the `src` directory to fetch data from Django backend.
2/Run React App:
```
npm start
```
# Step 8: Run Django Server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, your Django project with two apps (`resume` and `task`) and a connected React app should be set up. Adjust the details according to your specific requirements and project structure.
